# Materialize-CV-app
Just a fun project in MaterializeCSS.
This is my responsive CV as a website.
Hosted on Netlify - form attributes for connection to host added in HTML.
My personal data is not to be used in any way, shape or form. Other than that, this is MIT - U can take & modify it.
Most of the elements are just examplary Materialize components with some custom styling.
